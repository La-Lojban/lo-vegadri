# Contributing

Contributions are welcome.  Feel free to submit a issues and pull requests.  I'm happy to help or clarify any aspects of the code or design, if needed.

## Major tasks

### Design

* Semantics
* Implementation
* Type system
* Error reporting (especially from text -> CST)
* Formalization and reconciliation of lambda calculus and datalog in the context of Lojban

### Test

* QuickCheck
* Integration tests

### Translation

* System and documentation should be fully translated into Lojban
* Documentation and system design should then be queryable from the system itself

### Use cases

* Web browsing
* Shell-like commands
* Better integration with Emacs/IDE tools (i.e. GNU Global)
